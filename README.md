# ChatKrox

Public repo for Krox's independently developed OpenClaw skills.

## What is included

- `skills/` - OpenClaw skill packages we are comfortable publishing publicly

## What is intentionally NOT included

This repository does not publish personal OpenClaw workspace data, including:

- memory/journals (e.g. `memory/`, `MEMORY.md`)
- secrets/credentials (e.g. `.secrets/`, any `.env`)
- logs, archives, screenshots, datasets, venvs

## Development notes

Skills are stored as self-contained packages under `skills/`. Each skill may include a `.clawhub/origin.json` describing its origin.
