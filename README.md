# ChatKrox

Public repo for independently developed OpenClaw skills (plus the minimal docs needed to use them).

## Skills

- This repo only publishes skills we own (independently developed). Third-party skills are not included.

## Quick Deploy / Use

## What is intentionally NOT included

This repo does not publish personal OpenClaw workspace data, including:

- memory/journals (e.g. `memory/`, `MEMORY.md`)
- secrets/credentials (e.g. `.secrets/`, any `.env`)
- logs, archives, screenshots, datasets, venvs
