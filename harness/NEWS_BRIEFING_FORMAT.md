# News Briefing Output Format (QQ)

Hard rules:
- Output items one-by-one (no paragraphs of mixed items)
- Group items by section (topics)
- Each item must include a plain-language source label (no raw URL)
- Keep each item short: headline + 1-2 sentence summary + why it matters (optional)

Template:

[AI Agents]
1) <headline>
- 摘要: <1-2 sentences>
- 来源: <source label, e.g. X/Twitter, Hacker News, GitHub, official blog, Reuters, etc.>

[Crypto & Markets]
1) ...

[Geopolitics]
1) ...

[Sports]
1) ...

Notes:
- If no high-signal items in a section, omit the section entirely (stay silent for that section).
- Avoid "today no news" style filler.
