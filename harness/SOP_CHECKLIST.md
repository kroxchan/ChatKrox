# SOP Checklist (Always Run)

Before answering a web/reading/lookup request:

- Identify if a local skill/script exists; if hinted, verify it first.
- Run attempts in order: local -> web_fetch -> browser -> alt fetch.
- If failing, report attempted paths + reasons; ask for exactly one missing input.
