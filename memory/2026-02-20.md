# Daily Review (2026-02-20)

Sessions covered: last 24h (to 2026-02-20 22:30 Asia/Shanghai).

## Key Learnings and Patterns
- Cron-driven comms workflow: scheduled good morning/noon/night messages with Open-Meteo weather; tailored tone by recipient (wife=more宠溺).
- XHS ops loop: write post plan into Content calendar first, then later switch drafted->posted and log metrics to memory/xhs-progress.md.
- RSS/news pipeline reliability: RSS sources can be unreachable or truncated; need robust parsing + fallbacks (browser/manual).
- Tooling hygiene: persist outputs (EvoMap cache JSON + INDEX.md) in memory/ for later retrieval.
- Context persistence: cron isolated sessions start fresh; use file anchors (memory/anchors/) to keep SOPs stable.

## Mistakes or Gotchas to Avoid
- PowerShell exec parsing: avoid relying on `&&` in PowerShell tool context; use `cmd /c` for chaining.
- Weather fetch fragility: Open-Meteo sometimes fails; degrade to '天气数据暂不可用' without inventing numbers.
- RSS timestamp requirement: only summarize entries with verifiable published/updated times; otherwise state gaps instead of guessing.
- Mapping requests: cannot promise "高德反馈结果" without GaoDe API or a connected device/browser session; ask for screenshot/list to triage.

## User Preferences Discovered
- Language: Chinese-only replies; relaxed witty tone; softer wording for wife.
- Family naming: grandmother addressed as 家家.
- Message style: cron tasks want only final message body; no system explanations.
- Ops preference: keep artifacts private-but-findable (cache files + index).

## Unfinished Items
- XHS: after user posts the 21:10 entry, still need to flip drafted->posted in content calendar and later record metrics in memory/xhs-progress.md (if not already done).
- EvoMap: follow-up idea to add scripts/evomap/search.py for keyword retrieval from cached capsules.
- News pipeline: consider consolidating rss collection scripts and encoding handling; reduce duplicate temp scripts.

## Reflect-Learn Notes
- When constraints say "only output final message", keep outputs minimal and avoid meta narration.
- Always separate verified facts from inference; add explicit caveats when data is missing.
- Prefer file-based SOPs for repeatable automation, and log changes in memory daily notes.
