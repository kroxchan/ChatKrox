## Sessions (last 24h)

### Cron: 夜间Compounding复盘
- Task: Review last 24h sessions, extract learnings/mistakes/preferences/unfinshed, update memory files, commit.
- Note: In this 24h window, only this cron session was listed by `sessions_list`. Context for the actual work comes from `memory/2026-02-21.md` and `memory/2026-02-22.md` entries produced earlier today.

## Key learnings / patterns observed
- Ops debugging: Prefer "minimal verified fix" (e.g., `where openclaw`, `openclaw --version`) before broader refactors; always record side effects (PATH rebuild impact).
- Workflow anchoring: When cron sessions are isolated, file-based anchors (`memory/anchors/`) and daily logs become the stable source of truth.
- Content automation: Having multiple "source of truth" files for the same calendar causes drift; choose one and create an explicit sync rule.
- Legal-doc assist: For complex行政/维权, anchor to court-verified facts, then build multi-channel escalation ladder; phrase platform submissions as smallest actionable loops.

## Mistakes / gotchas to avoid (reflect-learn)
- Shell gotcha: PowerShell `&&` can fail in tool `exec`; use `cmd /c` for chained commands on Windows.
- PATH gotcha: Rewriting `HKCU\Environment\Path` to only npm path fixes `openclaw` but can break other toolchains; collect the user's tool list and rebuild PATH incrementally.
- Weather gotcha: Do not claim "data unavailable" when fetch succeeded; treat partial/parse errors separately and keep the raw fetch evidence for debugging.
- Session inventory gotcha: `sessions_list(activeMinutes=1440)` may not include user/main chats depending on runtime/channel; rely on `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` + transcripts when available.

## User preferences discovered/confirmed
- Chinese-only replies.
- In user-facing messages avoid markdown bullets `-` and bold `**` (files can use markdown).
- Tone: relaxed, witty, slightly sarcastic but kind; softer with wife.
- Safety: stop on login/captcha/payment/transfer keywords; no external sends without explicit confirmation.

## Unfinished items (carry-forward)
- Decide XHS content calendar single source of truth: `.openviking_data/.../51_Content_calendar_*.md` vs workspace `XHS_OPS.md`; implement sync if keeping both.
- Rebuild Windows user PATH safely (restore other tool entries) after the `%PATH%` corruption fix.
- Address/ignore plugin warnings: feishu duplicate id (only if Feishu will be used); qqbot extension being local/untracked.
- If needed: formalize AMap skill "mounting" into skills directory; document entrypoint.
- Legal-doc: user to pick final draft option (A/C/other) and provide deadlines/addresses for the 协商型履职申请.
- AMap food recommendation: needs precise user location + taste constraints.
- Resume: needs quantified achievements + tool stack + internship timeline to finalize.
